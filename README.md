# WebQuestions Semantic Parses Dataset
Quoting from Microsoft:
> The WebQuestionsSP dataset is released as part of our ACL-2016 paper “The Value of Semantic Parse Labeling for Knowledge Base Question Answering” [Yih, Richardson, Meek, Chang & Suh, 2016], in which we evaluated the value of gathering semantic parses, vs. answers, for a set of questions that originally comes from WebQuestions [Berant et al., 2013].
